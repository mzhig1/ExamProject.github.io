<p>My favourite assighment was a part of into to Javascript, the project was called "Project: Build-a-House" it was a fun project becasue I enjoy designing things.</p>

<h2>Coding challenge </h2>
<p>I have experience coding MineSweeper it was a summative project it was very fun to code and to learn how it was built and made teaching the class was a fun experience and showed a solid base in teaching and helping people learn how to code but also show room to grow my changes to the code weren't as big but still good in my opinion I changed the color and the amount of mines.</p>


<h2>Arduino Nano Board </h2>
<p>
we have learned how the Arduino Nano Board works from a computer engineer once a week my group got togther and coded and tryed to make 
the bored do different functions. We got the board to blink a light which was proof that now it not just about a code on a screen , that now we could acctully code on a physical object was very cool and inaddtion we added a button to when the we hit the button the light turns on the light the Arduino Nano Board was very challanging but fun and worth it in the end.</p>




<h2>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages </h2>



<h2>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h2>



<h2>Data </h2>
<p>Mr.Osudar has tought as about the importance of Data types and how they are used for exsample
Lists 
List (x,y) L=[n1,n2,n3â€¦,ny] 

Ordered sets
oset(x,y)O={n1,n2,..ny} 

Multi set  Mset(x,y)m=[n1 n2...ny]

Sets 
(x,y)s={n1 n2 ...ny}

</p>




<h1>Future</h1>
<p>In the future I hope to go to Uottawa or carlton univercity to become a computer software developer.I would  first like to get the khowledge from the greats like Daniel Shiffman,Elon Musk and other brilliant people using that information I would like to start up a tech compony that can inprove life of millions of people I have many ideas and It feels like they are limitless.</p>


<h2>previous experience</h2>
  
  <p>
    
  over the years I have gather valueble exsperiance from Mrs,Kerby and Mr,Osudar and got to learn many languages like
  </p>
  
  <li>turing</li>
 <li> adobe flash</li>
  <li>javascipt</li>
 <li> HTML/CSS</li>
 <li> Markdown</li>
  
   
   <p>
  some of these languages like turing is useless but a good way to learn the basics of coding.Adobe flash was a fun but very crashable software that would crash constantly but nonetheless it was used in creating a game for an a elementery school.Javascript was used in 
  understanding nature of code that would help me code more complex code in the future.Html/Css helped me make a cool website/blog like this one and markdown was used with html and is a very useful formating tool.
