<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Thanks to Mr.Osudar I have learned and familiarized myself with many computer science Concepts and languages Javascript,Html,Css and more.This knowledge will help me Become a better coder and a better professional.</p>

<h2>Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h2>
<h3>I have learned many things in javascript below there is a list of the things I have learned and achieved.</h3> 

<ul>
<li>Intro to programming</li>
<li>Drawing basics</li>
<li>Coloring</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Animation basics</li>
<li>Interactive programs</li>
<li>Resizing with variables</li>
<li>Text and strings</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Logic and if Statements</li>
<li>Debugging programs</li>
<li>Looping</li>
<li>Writing clean code</li>                    
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Design</li>

<p>My favourite assighment was a part of into to Javascript, the project was called "Project: Build-a-House" it was a fun project becasue I enjoy designing things.</p>



<h2>Coding challenge </h2>
<p>I have experience coding MineSweeper it was a summative project it was very fun to code and to learn how it was built and made teaching the class was a fun experience and showed a solid base in teaching and helping people learn how to code but also show room to grow my changes to the code weren't as big but still good in my opinion I changed the color and the amount of mines.</p>


<h2>Arduino Nano Board </h2>
<p>
we have learned how the Arduino Nano Board works from a computer engineer once a week my group got togther and coded and tryed to make 
the bored do different functions. We got the board to blink a light which was proof that now it not just about a code on a screen , that now we could acctully code on a physical object was very cool and inaddtion we added a button to when the we hit the button the light turns on the light the Arduino Nano Board was very challanging but fun and worth it in the end.</p>




<h2>Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages </h2>
<p>
  I have learned how to code a websites how to add pictures,text and color.althought its not fully completed I have gotten the basic understanding and knowledge to code this blog showing that even thought I havn't done all the work I know enough to made a great blog like this one  </p>


<h2>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h2>

<p>
 probably the hardest and most challanging thing I have done on khan academy the things listed blow is what we learned and the khowledge of theses conspepts would put me ahead due to there degree of difficulty and complexity but one of my favourite project was Project: Computational creatures it was the coolest thing I made in my opinion.</p>
 <li>Intro to Natural Simulations</li>
<li>Randomness</li>
<li>Noise</li>
<li>Vectors</li>
<li>Forces</li>
<li>Angular Movement</li>
<li>Oscillations</li>
<li>Particle Systems</li>
</ul>





<h2>Data </h2>
<p>Mr.Osudar has tought as about the importance of Data types and how they are used for exsample
Lists 
List (x,y) L=[n1,n2,n3â€¦,ny] 

Ordered sets
oset(x,y)O={n1,n2,..ny} 

Multi set  Mset(x,y)m=[n1 n2...ny]

Sets 
(x,y)s={n1 n2 ...ny}

</p>




<h1>Future</h1>
<p>In the future I hope to go to Uottawa or carlton univercity to become a computer software developer.I would  first like to get the khowledge from the greats like Daniel Shiffman,Elon Musk and other brilliant people using that information I would like to start up a tech compony that can inprove life of millions of people I have many ideas and It feels like they are limitless.</p>


<h2>previous experience</h2>
  
  <p>
    
  over the years I have gather valueble exsperiance from Mrs,Kerby and Mr,Osudar and got to learn many languages like
  </p>
  
  <li>turing</li>
 <li> adobe flash</li>
  <li>javascipt</li>
 <li> HTML/CSS</li>
 <li> Markdown</li>
  
   
   <p>
  some of these languages like turing is useless but a good way to learn the basics of coding.Adobe flash was a fun but very crashable software that would crash constantly but nonetheless it was used in creating a game for an a elementery school.Javascript was used in 
  understanding nature of code that would help me code more complex code in the future.Html/Css helped me make a cool website/blog like this one and markdown was used with html and is a very useful formating tool.
  </p>
  

<h2>Github and Git-it workflow</h2>

<p>Github is a wonderful tool to helps with version control and source code and many other things like hosting a blog.It is used in multimillion and billion dollar businesses and I'm glade I have a good understand on how to navigate and use this great platform.Github has many pluging like Git-It flow that helped me recape the basics of github.</p>
